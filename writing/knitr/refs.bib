Using these principles, the authors offer specific suggestions for modifications in 3 classic test construction approaches: (a) criterion keying, (b) inductive test construction, and (c) deductive test construction.

Abstract = {Psychometric theory focuses primarily on tests that are homogeneous, measuring only one attribute of a psychosocial entity. However, the complexity of psychosocial behavior often requires tests that are heterogeneous, measuring more than one attribute. In this presentation, reliability and internal consistency are extended to heterogeneous tests under the rubric of congeneric test theory. The extensions show that reliability and internal consistency have very similar properties. Reliability and internal consistency are shown to be unique up to a linear transformation. Whereas internal consistency is a lower bound to reliability in the homogeneous case, it is a strict lower bound in the heterogeneous case. Reliability equals internal consistency if and only if the test is homogeneous and true-score equivalent. An analytic argument shows that neither reliability nor internal consistency can detect whether a test is homogeneous or heterogeneous. The reliability (internal consistency) of },

We investigate how such concerns might influence conclusions concerning key issues such as prediction of job performance and adverse impact of selection procedures, as well as noting wider applications of these issues. We also start the process of building a better matrix upon which to base many such simulations and analyses in staffing research.

   Title = {Three {C}s in measurement models: Causal indicators, composite indicators, and covariates},
   Journal = {Psychological Methods},
   Abstract = {In the last 2 decades attention to causal (and formative) indicators has grown. Accompanying this growth has been the belief that one can classify indicators into 2 categories: effect (reflective) indicators and causal (formative) indicators. We argue that the dichotomous view is too simple. Instead, there are effect indicators and 3 types of variables on which a latent variable depends: causal indicators, composite (formative) indicators, and covariates (the “Three Cs”). Causal indicators have conceptual unity, and their effects on latent variables are structural. Covariates are not concept measures, but are variables to control to avoid bias in estimating the relations between measures and latent variables. Composite (formative) indicators form exact linear combinations of variables that need not share a concept. Their coefficients are weights rather than structural effects, and composites are a matter of convenience. The failure to distinguish the Three Cs has led to confusion and questions, such as, Are causal and formative indicators different names for the same indicator type? Should an equation with causal or formative indicators have an error term? Are the coefficients of causal indicators less stable than effect indicators? Distinguishing between causal and composite indicators and covariates goes a long way toward eliminating this confusion. We emphasize the key role that subject matter expertise plays in making these distinctions. We provide new guidelines for working with these variable types, including identification of models, scaling latent variables, parameter estimation, and validity assessment. A running empirical example on self-perceived health illustrates our major points. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved). (from the journal abstract)},

   Title = {Correcting for indirect range restriction in meta-analysis: Testing a new meta-analytic method},
   Abstract = {Accurate estimates of relationships are critical to research progress. In educational and personnel selection research, such estimates are typically distorted by range restriction. It is therefore important to correct for this distorting effect. However, while indirect range restriction is by far the most prevalent problem in research, available methods of meta-analysis are based on direct range restriction correction procedure. Using such inappropriate correction approach may result in biased estimates of the true relationships between constructs. Hunter, Schmidt, and Le (2003, manuscript submitted for publication) recently suggested a new model of indirect range restriction. Based on the model, the researchers developed a new method to correct for the problem of range restriction in meta-analysis. The dissertation is designed to provide a comprehensive assessment for the new method. First, the basic assumption underlying the new model of indirect range restriction was examined. Results show that when the assumption is violated, the true correlations are underestimated. However, the underestimations are generally less serious than those obtained by the existing method based on direct range restriction corrections. Just like the existing meta-analysis methods, the new method needs information about artifact distributions (i.e., range restriction on the predictor true score) to correct for their attenuating effects. Since such information is generally not available, a procedure was introduced to enable deriving the range restriction distributions of predictor true scores from several well-established generalized artifact distributions in the literature. The resulting distributions can then be used by substantive researchers to correct for the effect of indirect range restriction. Third, a series of simulations were carried out to test the accuracy of the new method. Results show that the method provided reasonably accurate estimates of the true correlations across different conditions. Finally, implications of using the new method in research were explored by re-analyzing data of a published meta-analysis examining the validities of employment interviews. Results indicated that different substantive conclusions could have been reached. It is therefore suggested that many meta-analysis studies in the literature may have underestimated the relationships between constructs.

  abstract = {In management research, there is a growing trend toward formative measurement, in which measures are treated as causes of constructs. Formative measurement can be contrasted with reflective measurement, in which constructs are specified as causes of measures. Although recent work seems to suggest that formative measurement is a viable alternative to reflective measurement, the emerging enthusiasm for formative measurement is based on conceptions of constructs, measures, and causality that are difficult to defend. This article critically compares reflective and formative measurement on the basis of dimensionality, internal consistency, identification, measurement error, construct validity, and causality. This comparison leads to the conclusion that the presumed viability of formative measurement is a fallacy, and the objectives of formative measurement can be achieved using alternative models with reflective measures.},

The implications of using meta-analysis methods for evaluating utilities of selection procedures and for assessing relative predictive capabilities of three popular selection tools (general mental ability tests, personality tests, and structured interviews) are further discussed. Based on these implications, we propose that meta-analysis can play an important role in bridging the gap between academic research and organizational practices.},

Neither attendance nor punctuality showed inter-rater agreement between the worker and his/her supervisor on either of the two occasions. Ratings of attendance were not stable across time for either the subordinate ( r=.16) or the supervisor ( r=.04), but punctuality ratings showed moderate temporal stability over 6 months for both subordinate ( r=.59) and supervisor ( r=. 41) impressions.

Unfortunately, the meta-analytic values estimates for validity and group differences (i.e., ? and ?, respectively) used in such matrices often vary in the extent to which they are affected by artifacts and how accurately the values capture the underlying constructs and the appropriate population. We investigate how such concerns might influence conclusions concerning key issues such as prediction of job performance and adverse impact of selection procedures, as well as noting wider applications of these issues. We also start the process of building a better matrix upon which to base many such simulations and analyses in staffing research. Finally, we offer guidelines to help researchers/practitioners better model human resources processes, and we suggest ways that researchers in a variety of areas can better as},
