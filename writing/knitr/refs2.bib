As the authors demonstrate in this article, mean-centering reduces nonessential collinearity but not essential collinearity. Therefore, in most cases, mean-centering of predictors does not accomplish its intended goal. In this article, the authors discuss and explain, through derivation of equations and empirical examples, that mean-centering changes lower order regression coefficients but not the highest order coefficients, does not change the fit of regression models, does not impact the power to detect moderating effects, and does not alter the reliability of product terms. The authors outline the positive effects of mean-centering, namely, the increased interpretability of the results and its importance for moderator analysis in structural equations and multilevel analysis. It is recommended that researchers center their predictor variables when their variables do not have meaningful zero-points within the range of the variables to assist in interpreting the results.},

	abstract = {The cross-product term in moderated regression may be collinear with its constituent parts, making it difficult to detect main, simple, and interaction effects. The literature shows that mean-centering can reduce the covariance between the linear and the interaction terms, thereby suggesting that it reduces collinearity. We analytically prove that mean-centering neither changes the computational precision of parameters, the sampling accuracy of main effects, simple effects, interaction effects, nor the R2. We also show that the determinants of the cross product matrix X′ X are identical for uncentered and mean-centered data, so the collinearity problem in the moderated regression is unchanged by mean-centering. Many empirical marketing researchers commonly mean-center their moderated regression data hoping that this will improve the precision of estimates from ill conditioned, collinear data, but unfortunately, this hope is futile. Therefore, researchers using moderated regression models should not mean-center in a specious attempt to mitigate collinearity between the linear and the interaction terms. Of course, researchers may wish to mean-center for interpretive purposes and other reasons.},

Scores on the SAT (a test widely used in the admissions process in the United States), secondary school grades, college grades, and SES measures from 143,606 students at 110 colleges and universities were examined, and results of these analyses were compared with results obtained using a 41-school data set including scores from the prior version of the SAT and using University of California data from prior research on the role of SES. In all the data sets, the SAT showed incremental validity over secondary school grades in predicting subsequent academic performance, and this incremental relationship was not substantially affected by controlling for SES. The SES of enrolled students was very similar to that of specific schools’ applicant pools, which suggests that the barrier to college for low-SES students in the United States is a lower rate of entering the college admissions process, rather than exclusion on the part of colleges.},

It should be on every applied statistician’s bookshelf." —The Statistician "The book should be studied in the statistical methods department in every statistical agency." —Journal of Official Statistics Statistical analysis of data sets with missing values is a pervasive problem for which standard methods are of limited value. The first edition of Statistical Analysis with Missing Data has been a standard reference on missing-data methods. Now, reflecting extensive developments in Bayesian methods for simulating posterior distributions, this Second Edition by two acknowledged experts on the subject offers a thoroughly up-to-date, reorganized survey of current methodology for handling missing-data problems. Blending theory and application, authors Roderick Little and Donald Rubin review historical approaches to the subject and describe rigorous yet simple methods for multivariate analysis with missing values. They then provide a coherent theory for analysis of problems based on likelihoods derived from statistical models for the data and the missing-data mechanism and apply the theory to a wide range of important missing-data problems. The new edition now enlarges its coverage to include:  Expanded coverage of Bayesian methodology, both theoretical and computational, and of multiple imputation Analysis of data with missing values where inferences are based on likelihoods derived from formal statistical models for the data-generating and missing-data mechanisms Applications of the approach in a variety of contexts including regression, factor analysis, contingency table analysis, time series, and sample survey inference Extensive references, examples, and exercises  Amstat News asked three review editors to rate their top five favorite books in the September 2003 issue.

Hunter and Schmidt introduced a procedure, called Case IV, for correcting correlations when a researcher has no information on the variable(s) used by an organization to form a suitability judgment. In this article, we compare Case IV to two other comparable procedures: the first correction (the expectation maximization algorithm) requires raw data about the selection variables used to form a suitability judgment. The second, the Pearson-Lawley correction, requires the variance-covariance matrix of the selection variables. We show that even when the variables used for selection are unobserved or unavailable, it is still possible to estimate parameters without making the restrictive assumptions of Case IV. In addition, these two corrections almost always outperform Case IV, particularly when the critical assumption of Case IV is violated. We also provide R code illustrating the use of these correction procedures.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},
