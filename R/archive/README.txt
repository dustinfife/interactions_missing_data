This folder contains results of previous Monte Carlos.

1. demonstration_Only_CaseIII contains the simulation where I centered variables before generating Y (which shows an advantage for uncentered variables). 

2. a. monte_carlo_run_runif I used to have skew values in my preliminary simulation, but it became difficult to compute the expected values/variances for a skewed variable. I knew I was going to include it in the final monte carlo anyway, so I just stopped varying skewness.
